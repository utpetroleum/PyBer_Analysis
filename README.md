# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
