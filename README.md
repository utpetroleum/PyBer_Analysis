# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
Pyber Summary Dataframe:

Based on the summary dataframe, we can see that the amount of "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", and "Total Fares" are the least in Rural area, the most in Urban area, and Suburban area in between.
The "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver" are the most in Rural area, the least in Urban area, and Suburban area in between.

Total Fare by City Type:

Based on the "Total Fare by City Type" on weekly basis plot, Rural area had the least amount of total fares, Urban area had the most amount of total fares, and Suburban had in between.

## Summary

###  Provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
To increase the amount of total fares in rural and suburban area, the CEO should incentivize more people to become drivers, which would result in more rides and fares. 
The average fare per ride was the least in urban area, the CEO should increase the fare for a ride to generate more revenue in urban area. 
The average fare per driver was the least in urban area, the CEO should increase the fare for a ride and it would increase the average fare per driver.
